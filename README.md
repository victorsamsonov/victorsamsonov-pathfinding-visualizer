I decided to challenge myself by building upon what I had learned In my previous classes and decided to implement algorithms that I learned in Discrete Structures such as the A* Algorithm and the Dijkstra's pathfinding algorithms. For this project I improved my Javascript, CSS and HTML knowledge, which resulted in creating an interactive Pathfinding Visualizer that included features such as adding walls, removing walls, randomly generating walls, clearing the board and visualizing the algorithm.

I plan to improve this project in the future.
